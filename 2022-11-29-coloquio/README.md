# Error Mitigation with Mitiq

Talk given at the [Coloquio de Cómputo Cuántico](https://proyectosrym.cic.ipn.mx/qcoloquio/) on behalf of Unitary Fund.
Talk was about 40 minutes with time for questions at the end, and about 50 people attended on zoom.
The "raw" slides are available [on github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natestemen/talks/main/2022-11-29-coloquio/prez.pdf), and the slides I marked up while giving the presentation are available on the [Unitary Fund drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17xWK-7PFWarmFnwkdGyO4ParWcwifAxq/view?usp=share_link).
The recording is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8XHaQ4uCRM.

Thanks to the organizers for hosting!
